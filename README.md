# Global Sales Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing global sales data to uncover trends, seasonality, and performance patterns across different countries, product lines, and time frames. It uses Python and popular data science libraries for end-to-end analysis and visual storytelling.

## Project Structure

- `globalsales.ipynb` ‚Äî Main Jupyter notebook containing all analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `global_sales.csv` ‚Äî Raw dataset of transactional-level global sales data.

## Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset.
- Perform time-based aggregations (quarterly, monthly, weekly).
- Visualize and interpret sales patterns over time.
- Identify top-performing product lines and countries.
- Analyze customer spending behavior by day and time.

## Key Visualizations

- **Quarterly & Monthly Order Trends**: Helps detect seasonal spikes or drops.
- **Top Product Lines by Revenue**: Identifies major revenue drivers.
- **Sales by Day of the Week**: Determines which days drive the most revenue.
- **Hourly Sales Trend**: Understands peak hours for purchases.
- **Spending Power by Country**: Boxplot and bar chart analysis to compare order value distributions.
